# ================================
# ========= STUDY DRILLS =========
# ================================

#1 Make your script print another line
print "Adding new line"

#2 Make your script print only one of the lines.
### Two options:
### 1 - Delete all lines except for line 1, in terminal run "python ex1.py"
### 2 - Comment out all lines except for line 1, in terminal run "python ex1.py" 


#3 Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
### Making comments are fun!
